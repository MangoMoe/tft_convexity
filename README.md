# tft_convexity
Attempting to derive strategies for Teamfight Tactics from convex analysis of the game

## Hi there!
I started this project for a class about linear programming because this game seems similar to typical linear programming problems (albeit with some nonlinearities) and I suspect that the space is convex or mostly convex.

## Sources
I got the data and some starter code from https://www.kaggle.com/jpdoyl20/tft-set-2 (thanks man!). I just hope I can finish this problem before set 3 comes out XD.
